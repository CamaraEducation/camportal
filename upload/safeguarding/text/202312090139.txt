                <p>Your underwear covers up your private parts and no one should ask to see or touch them. Sometimes a doctor, nurse or family member might have to. But they should always explain why, and ask you if it&apos;s OK first. Remember, what&apos;s in your pants belongs only to you.</p>

                <p>Your body belongs to you. No one should ever make you do things that make you feel embarrassed or uncomfortable. If someone asks to see, or tries to touch you, underneath your underwear, say &apos;NO&apos; &ndash; and tell someone you trust and like to speak to.</p>
                <p>No one has the right to make you do anything that makes you feel uncomfortable. If somebody does make you do something, it is never your fault. Even if the person who has made you feel uncomfortable, has told you it is your fault.</p>

                <p>There are good and bad secrets. Good secrets can be things like surprise parties or presents for other people. Bad secrets make you feel sad, worried or frightened. You should always talk to a safe adult whom you trust about a bad secret or anything that doesn&apos;t feel right.</p>

                <p>Talking should not get you into trouble, even if somebody has told you it will. If something has happened that makes you feel uncomfortable, it is never your fault.</p>
